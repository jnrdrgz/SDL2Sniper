# SDL2ZombieSniper

I tried to make a horizon perspective in 2D with SDL2.

Later I'm going to write a makefile, for now to play it just put this in the console:
```
g++ -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image Bullet.h Enemy.h Game.h Particles.cpp Bullet.cpp Enemy.cpp Game.cpp Particles.h TextureManager.cpp TextureManager.h Machete.cpp Machete.h main.cpp
```
