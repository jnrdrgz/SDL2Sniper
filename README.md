# SDL2ZombieSniper

I tried to make a horizon perspective in 2D with SDL2. The assets are just for test purposes.

## Controls

| Key                 | Action                      	 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------	 |
| `w`                 | Move the player towards the goal |
| `ad`                | Move the player left/right       |
| `Left Click`        | Shoot               	 		 |
| `Right Click`       | Aim               	 	     	 |
| `f`                 | Machete                          |

## Usage

To play it just:

    $ make all
	$ ./game

## Dependencies

*SDL 2.0*, *SDL Image*, *SDL Mixer*, and *SDL TTF*
